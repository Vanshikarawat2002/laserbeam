The Portfolio Manager is invested alongside clients."

We flex net exposure using index futures and options such as put spreads, collars and opportunistic call overwrites to neutralise market risk at low carry, add selective single name shorts where fundamentals are deteriorating or positioning is crowded, and hold cash when the opportunity set is thin."

Language models flag guidance shifts, management tone, competitive pressure and anomalies that are easy to miss at speed, while pattern detection surfaces repeatable set ups and builds live watchlists with entry and exit levels, catalysts and risks. The output is concise one page briefs and scenario tests that support quicker and better sizing decisions. It augments our work, it does not decide, and every idea still passes a fundamental review before capital is risked."

    label:"Risk management",
    para:"We are return focused and drawdown aware. Risk is set before entry: every trade has defined downside, a stop loss, and a position size based on conviction, liquidity and risk reward within name and sector limits. Gross and net exposure sit inside bands, with hedges and shorts used to neutralise unintended risks. Liquidity comes first, supported by event playbooks and ongoing stress tests across rates, currency, factors and commodities; portfolio drawdown triggers force action. Independent trustee, administration and audit provide oversight with daily reconciliation, and the Portfolio Manager invests alongside clients."
